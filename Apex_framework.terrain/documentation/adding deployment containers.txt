We have added a new logistics system

Currently using small shipping containers (since they can be both sling loaded and loaded onto HEMTT flatbeds without fancy scripting).

In the future we intend to create a way to spawn and configure them at a base or a central hub.

List of classnames:
	
	Land_Cargo10_brick_red_F
	Land_Cargo10_cyan_F
	Land_Cargo10_grey_F
	Land_Cargo10_light_blue_F
	Land_Cargo10_light_green_F
	Land_Cargo10_military_green_F
	Land_Cargo10_orange_F
	Land_Cargo10_red_F
	Land_Cargo10_sand_F
	Land_Cargo10_white_F
	Land_Cargo10_yellow_F
	Land_Cargo10_IDAP_F

Relevant files:

	"code\config\QS_data_deploymentPresets.sqf"
	"code\functions\QS_fnc_deployAssetPreset.sqf"

You can spawn them just like vehicles, by adding code to their init field as such:

	0 = [
		this,
		30,
		false,
		{},
		50,
		500,
		-1,
		true,
		4,
		1,
		{TRUE},
		[],
		0,
		{FALSE}
	] call QS_fnc_registerVehicle;

Here is a small list of what they each currently do:
